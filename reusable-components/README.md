# Splice Digital Reusable Component Library

A library of reusable components to easily drop into projects and to save estimate/dev time.

## Getting Started

We are using Storybook to preview components and configure them, it was integrated into this Next.js project by following [a simple guide](https://storybook.js.org/blog/get-started-with-storybook-and-next-js/).

To start Storybook and view the component library:

```
npm run storybook
```

## Guide for Adding New Components

TBD.
